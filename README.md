# 13-Oct-2024-Data-Cleaning

My intent is to start doing relatively small projects on a weekly basis, and share what I learned. For this effort, I wanted to practice my data cleaning skills, in either Excel or SQL. Further, I had hoped I would end up with data that could be put into a visualization. After examining the data, I decided that the data didn't need cleaning and wasn't suitable to put into a visualization. My biggest takeaway is that sometimes you need to know what NOT to do!
